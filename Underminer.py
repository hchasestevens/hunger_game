# ===UNDERMINER===
'''
General strategy:

- Assume other players are inferring identity via reputation.

- Assume (at least some of) these other players are employing tit-for-tat.

- If in a position with a slightly better reputation than some opponent
 and the ability to decrease own reputation to be slightly below the 
 projected lower bound of said opponent's next-round reputation, do so,
 thereby assuming their identity (and making gains) while simultaneously
 offloading some repercussions.
