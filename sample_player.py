        as well, and return it through hunt_choices.

        The main routine that plays each individual round.

        You must create an array of variables 'hunt_decisions' and assign an 'h' for hunt or
        an 's' for slack (i.e., not hunt) to each member of the array; the order of the hunt
        decisions in hunt_decisions should correspond to the order of opponents'
        reputations in player_reputations.

        Blank variables or errors will be assigned 's'.

        The variables passed in to hunt_choices for your use are:
            round_number: integer, the number round you are in.
            current_food: integer, the amount of food you have.
            current_reputation: float (python's representation of real numbers), your current reputation.
            m: integer, the threshold cooperation/hunting value for this round.
            player_reputations: list of floats, the reputations of all the remaining players in the game.
                                The ordinal positions of players in this list will be randomized each round.

                           The entries can be negative as it is possible to lose food from a hunt.

        add any code you wish to modify your variables based on the cooperation that occurred in
        the last round.

                   during the last round. the amount of food you have for the next round will be
                   current_food (including food_earnings from hunt_outcomes this round) + award.
